                    <span class="question">How do we do it?</span>
                    <p>To create a successful design we first must  learn about your company, your ideas, your plans and become an extension of your staff to allow us to create a product that is truly
                        a statement about your company</p>
                    <p>Solving a visual problem, building a website or designing priinted materials is a collaboration and an educational experience. We use planning and iteration to illustrate the possibilities. We listen. Making the end product something you are completely satisfied with.</p>
                    <span class="question">Pretty pictures</span>
                    <p>Counterspace was founded because we love three things. Design, information and education.</p>
                    <p>When we design its not about pretty pictures. Its not about putting a pretty wrapper on technology. It’s about using design techniques to allow users to read and comprehend the content they are viewing. To get a picture in their mind of the entity they are visiting.</p>
                    <p>The internet is information. Who, what, where and how. We organize information so that your audience is able to be entertained, informed and educated. </p>
                    <p>Education and learning drives us. Education is the reason why people internet surf, whether they are looking for the best deals or researching a paper. We help you plan your content and web site experience so that your users will be educated and will keep coming back.</p>
                    <p>We have spent the last decade living and breathing multimedia. Timelines, games, applications you name it we have produced successful products across a wide range of platforms and industries. </p>
                    <p>We founded counterspace to enable us to utilize our expertise, have fun and deliver high end products to our clients. Without compromise. Without excuses.</p>

                    <span class="question">Another design company?</span>
                    <p>We grew up with the internet, we had fun, we experimented and we helped develop interactivity standards and influence thousands of people online. We understand the internet. It’s history and it’s future.</p>
                    <p>The internet changes weekly and while we do not proclaim that we know everything, we use our experience to solve new problems, learn new </p>
